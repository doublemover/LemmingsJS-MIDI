# drawCornerRect note

tags: canvas, helper

`DisplayImage.drawCornerRect(x, y, size, r, g, b, cornerSize = 2)` paints filled squares at the four corners of a rectangle. The optional `cornerSize` controls the square size in pixels. This helper is currently unused after hover outlines switched to dashed rectangles only.
