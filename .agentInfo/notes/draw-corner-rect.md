# drawCornerRect note

tags: canvas, helper

`DisplayImage.drawCornerRect(x, y, size, r, g, b, cornerSize = 2)` paints filled squares at the four corners of a rectangle. The optional `cornerSize` controls the square size in pixels. GameDisplay uses this to show 3Â px corners around a hovered lemming.
