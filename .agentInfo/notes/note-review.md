# Note cleanup tasks

tags: todo, notes

The index lists many short notes. Review each file to remove duplicate sentences and keep the information concise. Focus on:
- `check-undefined.md` – ensure it only states the purpose and usage once.
- `game-gui.md` and `keyboard-shortcuts.md` – avoid repeating input details already covered in README.
- `game-view.md` and `stage.md` – clarify responsibilities and cross-link rather than duplicate descriptions of the canvas setup.
- `overview.md` – keep it high-level and link to docs for details rather than repeating entire README sections.
- Avoid trailing ellipses (`...`) in index summaries or note descriptions.

After editing, update `.agentInfo/index.md` if any notes are merged or renamed.
