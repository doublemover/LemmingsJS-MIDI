# NeoLemmix skills doc

tags: nl-skills, doc, resources

Short note summarizing the `docs/nl-skills.md` reference for the nine
additional NeoLemmix skills.  The doc lists usable skills while
swimming, glider deployment timing and behaviour, that Disarmer can
disable multiple traps, instant Stoner blocks, the eight-brick Stacker
limit and how Fencer digs upward.
