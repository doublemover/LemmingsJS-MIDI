# NeoLemmix Pack Toolkit notes

tags: pack-toolkit, resources, doc

The official "Flexi Toolkit" bundles levels and assets into a distributable NXP. It supports custom graphics sets, menu art, music rotations, talismans and replay management. The advanced tutorial details manual edits to `SYSTEM.DAT`, `levels/`, `replays/` and `files/`.

Our `docs/nl-pack-toolkit.md` lists these features and notes that each pack directory here follows a similar folder structure so Node tools can load them with `NodeFileProvider`. They are extracted from the original games rather than full Toolkit projects.
