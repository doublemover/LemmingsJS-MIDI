# L2 object file guesses

tags: lemmings2, object-files

docs/camanis/lemmings_2_object_files_question.md contains a speculative layout for Lemmings 2 object files. The notes map bytes like `ZZ`, `SS` and `GG` to properties such as steel, solidity and graphics IDs.

No loader implements this format yet. These guesses may inform future support for L2 packs.
