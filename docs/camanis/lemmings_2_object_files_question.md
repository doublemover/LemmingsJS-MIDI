# Lemmings 2 Object Files (Question)

This document preserves a text file from
[camanis.net](https://www.camanis.net/lemmings/files/docs/lemmings_2_object_files%3F.txt).
The original author tried to reverse engineer the object file format used by
Lemmings 2. The information is unverified and mostly speculation.

The raw notes are tucked away in the expandable section below so the page stays
readable.

some notes (guessing):

MAIN
NN 00 TT 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 05 00 SS 00

NN - number of graphics entries
TT - type(?)* -> effects animation
SS - sound effect

type value table
02: entry
03: exit
05: steel
06: water
09: deadly trap

SUB 
06 ZZ XX XX YY YY WW 68 II SS GG AA
first two bytes: likely event related
ZZ - 0x0f steel, 0x0a water

XX - rel. x-pos (+ trigger coord for last entry?)
YY - rel. y-pos (+ trigger coord for last entry?)
II - x-shifts trigger somehow sometimes
WW - creates weird gap under object
SS - solidity: 0x10 solid (steel), 0x40 background
GG - GFX-ID (ref. L2BI)
AA - lemming interaction event (?) - 0x10 permanent animation

XX=10) trigger pos & pos for 2nd steel tile
0x07-0x0a: 10 40 10 0D .. <-- 10 40 water; 10 00 exit; 10 80 water at pixel 8
10 00 08 00 <-- some x & y data (affects adding obj. of same kind left & right and alignment)
40 10 00 06 08 XX 00 YY 00 WW 68 II <-- XX/YY = trigger x/y-coord, WW creates weird gap under object, II x-shifts trigger somehow sometimes
